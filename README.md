Blood Bank Management System
A Blood Bank Management System implemented in C, which organizes donor details using a Binary Search Tree (BST). The system allows users to input, search, and manage donor information based on their blood group and location. This project was designed to simplify the management of blood donors in a structured and efficient way.

Features

Add Donors: Add donor information including name, blood group, phone number, and location.
Search Donors: Search for donors by blood group and location (e.g., cities like Mumbai, Pune, Nashik, Nagpur).
Display Donors: Displays all matching donors instead of just one.
Efficient Data Handling: Donor data is organized using a Binary Search Tree (BST) for fast searching and sorting.
Sample Data: Predefined sample donors from different cities for testing and demonstration purposes.


Data Structure Used
Binary Search Tree (BST): The donor information is stored in a binary search tree to allow efficient searching and sorting based on blood group and location.

Sample Donor Data
This project includes a predefined list of donors from four different cities (Mumbai, Pune, Nashik, Nagpur) for demonstration purposes. The donors are sorted by blood group and city for efficient searching.

Donor Information
Each donor entry contains the following details:

Name: Full name of the donor
Blood Group: Blood type (e.g., A+, B-, O+)
Phone Number: Contact number of the donor
Location: Donor's city (Mumbai, Pune, Nashik, Nagpur)

Usage

Upon running the program, you will be prompted to enter a blood group and a location.
The program will search through the BST and return a list of donors that match the criteria, displaying their name, blood group, phone number, and location.

Future Enhancements

Implement functionality to delete or update donor information.
Extend the search functionality to allow for partial matches on locations or names.
Add more donor information fields such as availability status and donation history.
